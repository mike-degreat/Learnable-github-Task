## 1. Explain Version control

Version control also known as source control is like a magical notebook that remembers everything. It keeps track of every change you make, along with who made it and when. You can rewind to any previous version, compare difference and even merge different versions together.

Think of it as a time machine for your files. Whether its code, documents, images or any other files, version control lets you:

> **Get back in time:** >_Imagine you made a mistake, with version control you can revert back to any previous version._

> **See the evolution:** _With version control you can trace the changes made over time_

> **Work together seamlessly:** _Collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work_

> **Experiment freely:** _Try out new ideas without ruining the original version_
